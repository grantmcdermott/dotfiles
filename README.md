# Dotfiles

A sample of my dotfiles, configs, etc.

_Note: The `.config/nvim` subdir is very lightly modified from Josean
Martinez's excellent guide
[here](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-neovim-2024). Please see the
link for required system deps (e.g., LazyGit, MesloFonts, etc.) My local setup
is Linux rather than Mac, but it was pretty simple to find the equivalent sysdep
source using my distro package manager._
